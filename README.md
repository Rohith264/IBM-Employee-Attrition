# IBM-Employee-Attrition

Attrition, in Human Resource terminology, refers to the phenomenon of the employees leaving the company. Attrition in a company is usually measured with a metric called attrition rate, which simply measures the no of employees moving out of the company (voluntary resigning or laid off by the company). Attrition Rate is also referred as churn rate or turnover. An organization is only as good as its best employees. In an ever-changing economy, it is getting harder and harder to retain best employees. You might be able to offer respectable wages, perks and a great working environment but there will be several other factors that come into play.
